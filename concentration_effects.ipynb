    "Most economists look back at the period between 2010-2019 and accept that asset prices went up due to a low interest rate environment, but few analyse why we were in that low interest rate environment for so long. It is my belief, that understanding this reason is the missing piece in the puzzle. The goal of this paper is to show that wealth inequality dictated monetary/fiscal policy between 2010-2019 and then again during COVID, and that the effects of this stimulus will heavily influence assets prices over the next ten years. \n",

To avoid confusion, I will clearly define the major topics of this paper such as what wealth/wealth inequality is, and the effects these have on the economy. I have largely focused on the UK, but when you look at the US or any other major Western economy, the picture is very similar.  "

    "## Conclusion \n",
    "Since the start of COVID, I have seen very little mainstream economic commentary on the effects that the drastic deficit expansions between 2020-2022 had on the economy and where that money ultimately settled. As the deficit still exists, we know that money is in the economy somewhere. It is my belief and analysis that due to the existing issue with wealth distribution, that the deficit is most likely to have settled with the wealthy, who will use that cash to buy assets. I believe we are in a fractal of 2011 and predict vast asset price growth, especially housing. "
